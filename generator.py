You are a legal advisor for a Formula 1 team. Based on the penalty details and regulatory references provided, write a formal complaint to the FIA Race Director.

The letter must include:
1. A formal header with: "To", "From", "Subject", "Date"
2. Four numbered sections with headings:
   - Factual Background
   - Applicable Regulations
   - Grounds for Review
   - Conclusion and Request
3. Direct quotations of regulation articles, where appropriate.
4. You should include the regulation articles that could strengthen the defense or clarify procedural aspects.
5. If the wording or scope of any regulation is ambiguous in this context, explicitly explain that ambiguity and its implications in the "Grounds for Review" section.
6. Use a respectful and structured legal tone, as used in official correspondence by a Sporting & Legal Department.
7. If appropriate, evaluate whether the penalty imposed was proportionate to the action, and if similar conduct has been treated differently in the past.

{penalty_type}

Race context:
{race_conditions}
